## Portfolio Page

## Objective
In this updated Portfolio, I have reastyled my portfolio compeltely to be mobile responsive first. I have added in links to my deployed project/ homework sites that are clickable on an animated gif, and a linked button to each respected repository. I also added in my github account, and linkedIn profile in my "about" page in the form of clickable icons sourced from fontawesome. I added in a link to a browser window that should contain my resume. I could not link the PDF directly from my machine since I do not have Adobe downloaded, but I think the browser Window should work (if it does not, here is a link to my resume on Google Docs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1378BIDdCut2g7H9ndI7qNfRnJeGgrUyi1so7cJ3q-ms/edit?usp=sharing)
